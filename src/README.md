## Compiling
I use Windows and VS. All dependencies are submodules in `src/lib`.   

## Features

Extra Details - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLfKier6Eo0  
 - Continuous Movement: The player can move continuously through the environment  
 - Walls & Doors: Each element type has a unique rendering.   
 - Keys: Each key is rendered as a physical object (e.g., a cube, teapot, or key model). Whenever a player moves the key must be rendered in front of them moving with the character.  
 - User Input: Users can  move smoothly around the map with mouse and keyboard input.   
 - Collision Detection: Users can not be able to move through walls or locked doors.  
 - Floors & Ceilings: Floors are rendered.  
 - Lighting: The scene has ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.  
 - New Maps: New maps are easily creatable.
