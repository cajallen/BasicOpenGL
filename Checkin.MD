## Project Description
I am working alone, and I will be working on the following in the listed order. I don't know how far I'll get.  
0. Multiple light sources  
1. Shadow mapping from directional lights  
2. Shadow mapping from point lights  
3. Map editing with real time updating  

## Progress plan
I have absolutely no plan whatsoever for the timeline of this project. As it is finals weeks for the other 4 classes I am in as well as this one, I am going to work on things whenever I have the time and motivation. I have started researching resources outside of what has been covered in class, and I expect directional shadow mapping to be relatively easy in the context of my next two goals. Again though, no clue when I'll find time to implement this.

## Expected Result
This is roughly what I want to have working if I finish all 3 of my goals. The map editing would simply be an ImGui grid with a number for tile height, i.e. 0 for floor, -1 for pit, 1 for half-wall, 2 for wall.
